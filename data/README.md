# python-docs-{{translation.language}}

Hello! This is the repository of the {{translation.language}} translation of the Python documentation.

**You can refer to the following resources throughout this journey:**

- [DevGuide Translating Section](https://devguide.python.org/documentation/translating/) (add your translation to the list!)
- [PEP 545](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0545/) (the PEP that describes the translation process)
- [Other Translations](https://github.com/orgs/python/repositories?q=python-docs) (see how other translations are doing it)
- [Python Docs Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/sMWqvzXvde) (especially the `#translations` channel)

## Documentation Contribution Agreement
Python's documentation is maintained using a global network of volunteers. By posting this project on Transifex, Github, and other public places, and inviting you to participate, we are proposing an agreement that you will provide your improvements to Python's documentation or the translation of Python's documentation for the PSF's use under the CC0 license (available at https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode). In return, you may publicly claim credit for the portion of the translation you contributed and if your translation is accepted by the PSF, you may (but are not required to) submit a patch including an appropriate annotation in the Misc/ACKS or TRANSLATORS file. Although nothing in this Documentation Contribution Agreement obligates the PSF to incorporate your textual contribution, your participation in the Python community is welcomed and appreciated.

You signify acceptance of this agreement by submitting your work to the PSF for inclusion in the documentation.

***Do not forget to replace this file with your own README that describes your translation and community, while keeping the above agreement!***
